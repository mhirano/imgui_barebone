- OpenCV for image processing  
Install OpenCV as you like.
- Dependencies for Dear ImGui  
    - SDL2 for OpenGL library
    - GLFW for OpenGL library
    - GLM for math library for graphics
```Shell
$ sudo apt update # Be sure to update repository
$ sudo apt install -y libsdl2-dev
$ sudo apt install -y libx11-dev xorg-dev libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev
$ sudo apt install -y libglfw3 libglfw3-dev
$ sudo apt install -y libglew-dev
$ sudo apt install -y libglm-dev
```
##### For Mac users
*Homebrew* is a awesome package manager for Mac. Visit `https://brew.sh/index_ja` to install Homebrew.
